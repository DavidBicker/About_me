            Injuries are a part of life. some have injuries early on
            other have more severones. My own injuries are mostly physical
            the most recent injuries are part of the reason I have come to code.
            I have spend about a full year in the last 5 not being ablle to walk,
            that sucks for a lot of reasons. it was also great for becoming pretty
            good at videogames. It was also a large reason for my choice of what to 
            study while in college. 
         </p>
          <p> TL:DR-couldn't walk, turned to compuerters for something to keep busy
